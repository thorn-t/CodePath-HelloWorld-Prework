## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
One thing that troubled me with Android Studio was getting the emulator setup initially. It downloads emulators by defaults to the C:\ drive even when I had it installed on D:\ so I had to change the environment variable for it and redownload the emulators.
